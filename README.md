# my-sites
I am a junior webmaster and here I put my different projects. 
I make them to simplify my daily activities and to share good ideas, style and visual pleasure with everyone.

Here you can download my sites.
Most of them are written in HTML, CSS & JavaScript so you don't need a server to make them work, you only need to
download the site and start the file "index.html" in your browser.
