Hello!

This is a simple feedback form for your site.

It includes a button to put on your site and a form itself.

To launch the feedback form:
1. Copy the files to the root directory of your site. The "images" directory should not be renamed. If you already have "images" directory at your site, you can just copy the pictures there.
The rest of the files should be together in the common directory.
You can put the whole feedback project in a special directory but then write the correct URLs to all of the files.
2. Open the file "feedback-form__button.html" in your code editor and copy the whole code from <body> container. Put it on the right place at your site. Don't forget to attach stylesheet "modal-contact-form.css".
3. Enjoy the feedback form! By the way it's written in Russian. Hope that it would be easy for you to make a translation if Russian is not your language.

P.S. The form contains PHP scripts so you will need a server to try how it works. If you try the form in the browser without Internet, then after pressing the submit button called "Отправить" you will just see the PHP script, because browsers cannot process PHP.
